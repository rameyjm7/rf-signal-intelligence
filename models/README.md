# Model Artifacts

This public repository does not include trained model weights, TensorRT engines,
ONNX exports, checkpoints, generated IQ samples, or calibration captures.

The public repo provides source code, training/evaluation workflows, export
scripts, model cards, and result summaries. Bring your own trained artifacts,
train models with the provided workflows, or contact Jacob Ramey / RTG LLC to
license validated model artifacts and commercial integrations.

## Layout

```text
models/
  README.md
  noisy_drone_rf_v2/
    labels.json              Public class labels only.
    run_onnx_inference.sh    Example runner; requires a local/private model.
```

## Expected Local/Private Artifacts

Common artifact types intentionally excluded from public Git:

- `*.keras`, `*.h5`, `*.onnx`, `*.engine`
- model checkpoints and TensorRT build outputs
- generated or captured IQ: `*.npy`, `*.npz`, `*.bin`, `*.c64`, `*.iq`
- replay manifests that point to private captures
- production calibration data and deployment configs

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# Train or copy a private/licensed model artifact locally.
python exports/export_noisy_drone_to_onnx.py \
  --keras-model /path/to/private/model.keras \
  --out /path/to/private/model.onnx
```

```bash
# Run inference with a local/private artifact.
python exports/run_onnx_inference.py \
  --onnx /path/to/private/model.onnx \
  --iq-file /path/to/local/sample.npy \
  --labels models/noisy_drone_rf_v2/labels.json
```
